              <summary>1. Refund Eligibility</summary>
                <p>
                  At Fly High Airlines, we strive to ensure a seamless travel experience for all passengers. 
                  Refund eligibility depends on the type of fare purchased. Fully refundable tickets may qualify 
                  for a full refund if canceled within the applicable time frame, while non-refundable tickets 
                  may only be eligible for a credit or refund under certain conditions, such as flight cancellations 
                  by the airline or significant schedule changes.

              <summary>2.  Refund Request Process</summary>
                <p>
                  Passengers seeking a refund should submit their request online via the Fly High Airlines website or by 
                  contacting our customer service team. Refund requests must include booking details, passenger information, 
                  and a valid reason for cancellation (if applicable). Please note that refunds for tickets purchased through 
                  travel agencies or third-party platforms must be processed through the original point of sale.

              <summary>3. Refund Time Frame</summary>
                <p>
                  Refunds for eligible tickets will be processed within 7-10 business days from the date of approval for 
                  credit card purchases. Refunds for payments made with cash or bank transfers may take up to 20 business days. 
                  Delays in refund processing may occur due to external factors such as payment provider policies or bank processing times.

              <summary>4. Flight Cancellations by Airline</summary>
                <p>
                  In the event Fly High Airlines cancels a flight, passengers are entitled to a full refund of the ticket price, or 
                  they may choose to rebook on an alternative flight without incurring additional charges. In cases of significant 
                  delays or schedule changes, passengers may also be eligible for a refund if the revised schedule does not meet their needs.

              <summary>5. Refund Exceptions</summary>
                <p>
                  Certain fare types, such as deeply discounted promotional fares or group bookings, may have specific restrictions 
                  regarding refunds. Passengers are encouraged to review the fare rules and conditions at the time of booking 
                  to understand any limitations or exceptions to the refund policy.
